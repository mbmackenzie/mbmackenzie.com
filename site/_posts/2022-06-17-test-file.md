It is a test of what I would like to be able to showcase in a blog post

## Multiple sections

Maybe a list here:

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

## Perhaps a subsection

Obviously some code.

```python
def test():
    print("Hello World")
```

## Next section

Some math is always good.

$$
x = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
$$

A table would be nice too

| Header 1 | Header 2 | Header 3 |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Cell 1   | Cell 2   | Cell 3   |
